Classifying Liver Transplant Candidates
-
This project uses the 'Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) for Egyptian Patients Data Set' from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Hepatitis+C+Virus+%28HCV%29+for+Egyptian+patients#)

Objective
-
- To classify patients as candidates for liver transplants based on the progression of Cirrhosis

- Please note that when being considered for a transplant, other factors determine patient candidacy aside from the progression of Cirrhosis, including:
  - ability to tolerate major surgery
  - understanding risk and long-term care/ financial responsibilities
  - no other life-threatening conditions/brain damage that cannot be treated or cured
  - history of medical noncompliance
  - untreated chronic and ongoing drug use, history of serious psychiatric disorders that cannot be treated before transplantation
  - high risk for ongoing or increased severity of the psychiatric disorder


Data Processing
-
- Create dummy variables for categorical features (gender, physical symptoms like headaches, nausea + vomiting, fatigues, aches, jaundice, and pain)
